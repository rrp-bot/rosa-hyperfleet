# ROSA HyperFleet

## Overview

The ROSA HyperFleet project is a strategic initiative to redesign the architecture of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with Hosted Control Planes (HCP). This new architecture moves away from a globally-centralized management model to a regionally-distributed approach, where each AWS region operates independently with its own control plane infrastructure.

The goal is to improve reliability, reduce dependencies on global services, and provide customers with lower-latency access to cluster management through regional API endpoints.

## Architecture at a Glance

The architecture consists of three layers within each region:

1. **Regional Cluster (RC)** - EKS-based cluster running core services (Platform API, hyperfleet-operator, kube-applier, ArgoCD, Tekton)
2. **Management Clusters (MC)** - EKS clusters hosting customer Hosted Control Planes via HyperShift
3. **Customer Hosted Clusters** - ROSA HCP clusters with control planes in MCs and workers in customer accounts

## Scope

- This architecture is designed exclusively for **ROSA HCP** (Hosted Control Planes)
- ROSA Classic and OSD clusters are not part of this architecture
- All ROSA HCP clusters will eventually migrate to this regional architecture

## Current Status

This is an active development project. Some design decisions are still pending — see [FAQ](FAQ.md) for details on open questions.
